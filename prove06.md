|Vertex|Adjacent Verticies|
|:-:|:-:|
|0||
|1||
|2||
|3||
|4||

## Question 2 (4 points)

The list of 9 graphs below have 4 pairs of isomorphic graphs.  Find the 4 pairs.  Note that one of the graphs does not have a match.

## Question 3 (15 points)

Write python code to create an adjacency table for the undirected graph below.  Second, implement the `find_neighbors` function which will take as input vertex and the adjaceny table and returns a list of verticies that are adjacent to the input vertex.  Finally, implement the `is_neighbor` which takes two verticies and the adjaceny table and returns True if they are adjacent; False otherwise.

![](prove06_graph3.png)

```python
adjacency_table = None # Add your code here

def find_neighbors(vertex, adjaceny_table):
    # Add your code here
    return None

def is_neighbor(vertex1, vertex2, adjacency_table):
    # Add your code here
    return None

print(find_neighbors('A', adjacency_table)) # should print ['B', 'C']
print(find_neighbors('D', adjacency_table)) # should print ['C', 'E', 'F']

print(is_neighbor('A','B',adjacency_table)) # True
print(is_neighbor('D','F',adjacency_table)) # True
print(is_neighbor('C','F',adjacency_table)) # False
```

## Question 4 (6 points)

Determine if the graph below has an Euler Circuit.  If it does, then write down the sequence of verticies that make up the Euler Circuit.  If it does not, then write "No Euler Cycle"

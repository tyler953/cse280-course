## Question 1 (3 points)

Tessie and her friends have between them 15 board games, 12 card games, and 1 word game.  If their game nights feature the word game plus one other game (either a board game or a card game), how many different game nights can they have?

**Answer**: 

## Question 2 (3 points)

Now Tessie and her friends have acquired two more word games (for a total of 3) and have deided to vary the snacks they munch on while playing games.  They have selected 7 different types of snacks.  If a game-night configuration consists of a word game, another game (either a board or card game), and a snack, then how many different game-night configurations are possible now?

**Answer**: 

## Question 3 (3 points)

How many different 8-character passwords are possible if all uppercase (A-Z), lowercase (a-z), and digits (0-9) are allowed?

**Answer**: 

## Question 4 (3 points)

How many three-letter acronyms (arrangements of 3 alphabetic letters) are there with repetition allowed?  Assume uppercase (A-Z) only.

**Answer**: 

## Question 5 (3 points)

How many three-letter acronyms (arrangements of 3 alphabetic letters) are there with repetition **not** allowed?  Assume uppercase (A-Z) only.

**Answer**: 

## Question 6 (3 points)

How many different sequences can be formed using either two or three letters (A-Z) followed by either two or three digits (0-9)?

For example:
* AB01
* ABC12
* XY236
* XYZ123

**Answer**: 

## Question 7 (4 points)

Suppose you flip a fair coin 10 times.  Determine how many ways you can get each of the scenarios in the table below.

|Scenario|Number of Ways|
|:-:|:-:|
|no heads||
|exactly one head||
|exactly two heads||
|at least two heads||

## Question 8 (3 points)

Consider the following fruit that is available to you: raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, apples, oranges, bananas, kiwi, papaya, and mango.  Just choosing five from the list of 9, how many different combinations of fruit salad can you make?

**Answer**: 

## Question 9 (3 points)

What is the number of different strings that can be formed by reordering the characters in the word `SUCCESS`?

**Answer**: 

## Question 10 (22 points)

### Part 1

Implement the `P` function and the `C` function to compute the $r$-permutation and $r$-combination, respectively for a set of size $n$.  You will need to use the `factorial` function provided in the `math` library in Python.

```python
from math import factorial
# factorial(6) = 6! = 720

def P(n,r):
    # Add your code here.  Recommend using integer division instead of regular division
    pass

def C(n,r):
    # Add your code here.  Recommend using integer division instead of regular division
    pass

```

### Part 2

Use the `P(n,r)` function you wrote to answer the following problems:

|Scenario|Answer|
|:-:|:-:|
|How many different arrangements can be made of 5 people from a group of 8 people to stand in line for a picture?||
|How many different ways can 8 different projects be assigned to 26 people?  Only one project per person.  Not all people will be assigned to a project.||
|How many different ways can we assign 15 pilots to 100 possible flight schedules?||

### Part 3

Use the `C(n,r)` function you wrote to answer the following problems:

|Scenario|Answer|
|:-:|:-:|
|How many ways can we form a committee of 5 people from a group of 8 people?||
|How many ways can we select 8 people from a group of 26 people to work on a single project, assuming all people are equally qualified?||
|How many ways can we selet 15 winners for a vacation drawing from a group of 100 contestants assuming each prize is the same?||
